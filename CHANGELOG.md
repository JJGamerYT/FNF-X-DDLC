# Changelog
All notable changes will be documented in this file.

(the mod held me at gunpoint asking me to add this file so here ya go)


2.0: THE ACT 2 UPDATE
HUGE UPDATE/OVERHAUL. Not gonna list everything, but: REDID THE ART FROM THE GROUND UP (worth), ADDED A WHOLE NEW SECTION OF THE MOD: ACT 2, made some code, game, and story improvements, squashed some bugs, and basically made this the coolest DDLC FNF mod there is.


1.2: The Give Em' What They Want Update
Added a few Kade Engine features (Ghost tapping and note offset), Added an unused animation in the game files in game, changed the ending of Bottles, fixed problems with normal and easy charts, and other stupid bugs I was too lazy to list at the time.

1.1: The Nothing Update
Close to 0 things happened. Tried to salvage the art and added a very basic skip function.

1.0:
The start of this little mod.
