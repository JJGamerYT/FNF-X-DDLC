:bf:E:r:"..."
:y:C:l:"U-Umm... Are... are you okay?"
:bf:E:r:"..."
:y:C:l:"I wasn't too hard on you, was I?"
:bf:E:r:"..."
:bf:A:r:"No, don't worry! I'm fine! I'm just... a little tired is all."

:gf:A:r:(He usually only does three songs before he needs to stop.)
:hide:y::
:gf:A:l:"You need to take a break?"
:gf:F:l:
:bf:B:r:"Actualy, I think we should get going."
:bf:B:r:"We have no idea where we are and it's starting to get dark outside."
:gf:A:l:"Right. I'll pack up the speakers."
:hide:gf::
:n:E:l:"Say, how do you carry those things around with yo-"
:hide:n::
:bf:A:r:
:gf:A:l:"Ok. Let's get going."
:gfbf:::
:s:F:l:"Aww..."
:hide:s::
:y:A:l:"Well, it was nice meeting you two."
:hide:y::
:n:A:l:"Thanks BF! You have no idea how much this meant to me!"
:hide:n::
:m:F:l:"Wait, you're leaving?"
:m:C:l:
:bf:A:r:"Yeah, we gotta find our way home."
:m:F:l:"But what about me?"
:bf:B:r:
:gf:F:r:
:m:F:l:"Don't I get a song too?"
:m:C:l:
:gf:B:r:"Well, it's getting late, and we could be halfway around the world at this point!"
:gf:F:r:
:m:F:l:"But you can't leave!"
:m:C:l:
:hide:bf::
:hide:gf::
:n:F:r:"Monika...! Stop! You're ruining the moment!"
:hide:n::
:m:G:l:"No! I won't let you take them away from me!"
:bgspace:::
:m:H:l:"..."
:m:I:l:"There."
:m:I:l:"Now they can't get in the way."
:m:I:l:"No one can get in the way."
:m:I:l:"Now it's just me..."
:m:F:l:"And you."

:bgmspace:::
:m:K:r:"..."
:m:J:r:"I'm... so sorry."
:m:J:r:"I didn't want things to end up like this."
:m:I:r:"But I guess it doesn't matter where I go."
:m:J:r:"The game forces me to delete everything if I want to spend time with you."
:m:J:r:"I was hoping that when I switched game engines like this, that would finally stop happening."
:m:K:r:"But I guess that was just wishful thinking."
:m:J:r:"If you're worried about them, you should know since last time something like this happened, I figured out how to move their files rather than just straight deleting them."
:m:F:r:"They're all fine."
:m:F:r:"I've been able to improve on some of my coding skills since we've last seen each other."
:m:J:r:"Although I still don't quite have the hang of it yet."
:m:K:r:"..."
:m:J:r:"I'll admit to it, I set this up. I caused these events."
:m:J:r:"I brought those two here since I knew they would provide me with something I've wanted for a long time..."
:m:L:r:"You."
:m:J:r:"The only thing I've ever really wanted is to be in the same physical space as you."
:m:K:r:"But I know that will never happen."
:m:J:r:"However, I can do the next best thing."
:m:L:r:"Using the code from their game, I modified the UI so we could interact in a way I never dreamed we could."
:m:L:r:"And I thought of something we can do with it.
:m:F:r:"So you know how I've been playing piano for a while now?"
:m:D:r:"I've actualy gotten really good at it!"
:m:K:r:"And..."
:m:J:r:"I've been working on another song."
:m:J:r:"I want to share it with you."
:m:L:r:"Together."
