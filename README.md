Now, enough with the thank you's. Let's get to business.

## Modding
If you're thinking of modding the game (Which you likely are if you're here.), there are a few things you'll need to know before starting.

1. This mod was made on it's own slightly modified in-house engine, JJ's Jammin' engine, made by your's truly. It's basicly the normal FNF engine but with small additions here and there, including basic Kade engine suport (Note offset, Ghost tapping, and controll remaping), and some new chart editor options.

2. The dialogue system within this mod is **HEAVILY MODDIFIED** from the original FNF's. It uses only one .png file for all the faces in a characters portrait. It does this magic with tweening, code from the health icons, and some funi math. There are also many other small but important parts that make it function the way it does, but you should be able to figure it out without to much trouble. Bug me enough about it and I'll release the dialogue system as a standalone that you can just click and drag to get going.

3. The sprites in this mod were **NOT** made in Flash but instead made in Illustrator and then ported to Flash. You can still use Flash/Animate to edit them, but it's best to use Illustrator or another vector based art program. (Both the Flash and Illustrator files are provided.)

4. If you do happen to make a mod of my mod, all I ask is that you credit me somewhere within it. (_and i mean if you wanted to slap any of my cool links above in there that would be kinda swagness_)

Short, yet useful, that's all you need to know!

Have a nice weekend!
